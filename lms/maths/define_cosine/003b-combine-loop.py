# this smells like PI time :)... but, I am going to do this step by step and not jump yet

# !!! ok this was a fun exercise to get points evenly spaced and it at least appears close to spaced out! based on initial step size of a then all subsequents steps are set so that a_diff^2 + b_diff^2 == c_diff^2 such that c_diff^2 is constant across all points
# as you take this to zero, you would get a concept of theta then
# c_diff^2 is the lenght of the line between consecutive points, so it IS NOT the arc but it is an approximation
#   and as c_diff => 0 then it becomes the arc  and you can then sum that to get the circumference
#   I think... I am still playing with this new way of thinking about this and need some more tinkering
