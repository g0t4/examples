# definitionally:
#   cos(θ) = adjacent/hypotenuse
# and:
#   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
#   ==> c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
# then, restate:
#   a == adjacent, c = hypotenuse
#
#   ==> cos(θ) = a / c
# therefore:
#   cos(θ) = a / c  = a/sqrt(a^2+b^2)
#
# take two unit vectors that start out fully overlapping
#   --->
#   start at origin, point right only
#   magnitude 1 for both
#   all in a/x component
#
#   throughout this exercise, they will both remain unit vectors (magnitued = 1)
#   I want to slowly rotate one around origin, until it gets to a right angle where it has no x-axis component, and y=1 for its y component (b/c its always a unit vector)
#   just thinking about this w/o any math yet
#   - when right angle with one unit vector pointing up or down, fully... (all in the y component) then there is NO OVERLAP (0)
#     θ=90 => cos(90°) = 0
#     θ=270 => cos(270°) = 0
#   - when fully overlap => overlap is 1
#     θ=0 => cos(0°) = 1
#   - when one left (fully, no y component) then the overlap == -1
#     θ=180 => cos(180°) = -1
#
# to do this, I will plot it as taking the a (x-axis) component and decreasing it
#   which means its b has to increase as its a decreases, to match a magnitude of 1
#   using this formula:
#     a/sqrt(a^2+b^2)
#     aka:
#     x/sqrt(x^2+y^2)
#
# ok now
#   a^2 + b^2 = c^2 (c is hypotenuse or mag... == 1)
#   a^2 + b^2 = 1
#   b = sqrt(1-a^2)
#   a starts at 1, b = 0
#   eventually a => 0, b => 1
#   then a => -1 while b => 0
#   then a => 0 while b => -1
#   finally a => 1 while b => 0
#
#
# if I plot a vs b => turns into a circle
#
# if I plot cos(θ) => I then need to vary b as a function of a:
#    b = sqrt(1-a^2)
#    and then I plot
#    a/sqrt(a^2+b^2)

# take two unit vectors
# theta (angle between)

# θ = 0° = full overlap
#  => 1

# 45 degrees
# a^2 + b^2 = c^2
# a = b => 2a^2 = c^2 => a^2 = c^2/2 => a = sqrt(c^2/2) => a = c/sqrt(2)
# => a/c = 1/sqrt(2) = cos(theta) => ~0.71

# FYI maybe use
# a^2 + b^2 = c^2
# =>   a = adjacent, b = opposite, c = hypotenuse
# a^2 + o^2 = h^2

# 90 degrees = no overlap
#  => 0

# 180 degrees = inverted overlap (fully)
#  => -1

# 270 degrees = no overlap
#  => 0

# 360 == 0 => full overlap
#  => 1

# * ok unique observation here is that by varying a linearly  (1 => 0 => -1)
#   by fixed step 0.01
#   the tip of the unit vector drawn are unevenly distributed
#   right away there's a big jump up and then the spacing of points falls off from there
#   as a gets to 0 the points become densly clustered!
#   this means something
# * THEN, I also notice that I need to define b different to capture the bottom half of the circle if you will
#   as -1 => a => 1 ... then I need b inverted
#   this is nothing special, just the convention of expressing the unit vector
#   BUT, I am having trouble then defining an infinite sequence that would allow me to
#      let the animation run in perpituity
#      I could solve this with a loop over two loops.. I will add that change next
