# sudo apt install -y python3-libgpiod # for system packages, can this work in a venv?
#   seems like I might need apt to install deps for gpiod... version in venv doesn't work but then if I move out of venv it works

# !!! TIMING MIGHT BE WORKING in my python!
# !!! ok my timing looks close enough now actually, so I might have smth wrong with the protocol, let's revisit that next ... I am within the tolerances I understand and still don't get a response to the read ROM... I bet I have smth off in my understanding
#  DO NOT BE SLOPPY with prints or anything that adds overhead... one print can add 50us, same with not carefully choosing when to drive line low (before/after requesting output mode)
# PRN might be able to keep a list of messages and dump on a failure/completino as long as adding to the list is trivial <1us timing
# !!! WES KEEP IN MIND timing might not work out in python still... c code would rock and you can have logging there that doesn't kill perf (i.e. pr_ dev_ printk_ in a module)

# FYI I checked out libgpiod for the APIs => https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.gitÃŸ => libgpiod/bindings/python

# IIUC, as of v2.0.2 they made breaking changes to the APIs that replaced the unofficial pure python APIS (must be the system pkg version b/c it is 1.6.3)... and going forward it sounds like the new APIs are via pypi pkg only (not apt installed cpython pkg)... I bet that is is, the cpython impl is probably not updated to 2.x b/c that would break reality, and so its left at that point in time and won't ever be migrated to 2.x... would make sense
